Application settings need to be [configured in `appsettings.json`](./application-configuration) or your deployment host.

| File                             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AutomaticallyApplyEfMigrations` | `true` to automatically apply Entity Framework migrations. If this is set to false, EF migrations must be manually applied. This setting is ignored for non-relational databases like the in-memory provider. |
| `LogOutInactiveDeviceDays`       | The number of days of inactivity (no contact) before a device is logged out.                                                                                                                                  |
| `RequireEmailVerification`       | `true` to require users to verify their emails before they log in.                                                                                                                                            |
| `RequireTwoFactorForNewUsers`    | `true` to require two-factor email authentication for new users. It does not change existing users.                                                                                                           |
| `SiteUrlRootForEmails`           | The root URL used in emails. This should be the base URL where the Angular app is hosted from (e.g., `https://localhost:4200/` in development).                                                               |
| `UseSameSiteStrictCookies`       | `true` to use SameSite strict cookies. Set this to `false` if debugging the frontend from a different URL root (like `http://localhost:4200/` for Angular).                                                  |
